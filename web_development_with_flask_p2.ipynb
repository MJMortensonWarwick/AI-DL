This is done to allow us to create CSRF protection to our form ... which we implement via the _CSFRProtect(app)_ function. CSFR stands for Cross-Site Forgery Request. You can read more about CSRF [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf), but the TL;DR version is that they are cyber attacks that trick users into changing things on their account via forms. CSFR protects any POST request being corrupted by a hacker.\n",

In otherwords, \"UserForm\" is a custom class we have built, but it is a sub-class of the standard _FlaskForm_ solution. Our form contains a bunch of form fields we want the user to fill in of various types ... similar to datatypes in databases. The full list is:\n",
        "* name: a string/text field\n",
        "* email: an email address field\n",

        "\n",
        "Finally we have a new route/function to our final page (\"/form\" which leads to the \"templates/formpage.html\" file. Unlike in our previous examples here we specify two HTTP request methods - \"GET\" and \"POST\". The other pages have skipped this, which means defaulting to GET as the basic mechanism. On our form page we will want the user to be able to see the content of the page (a GET request) but we will also want users to fill in the form and send the data (a POST request).\n",
