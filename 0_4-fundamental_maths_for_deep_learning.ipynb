        "The chain rule gets us a big chunk of the way towards what we need in terms of using derivatives to understand parameter optimisation in deep learning (which will be explained in the module don't worry), except for one thing. Everything we've looked at so far has looked at changes in $y$ with respect to a single $x$. We theoretically could have just one feature, but in ML/AI practice that is extremely unlikely. If we have multiple features ($x$'s), which we will, we need _partial derivatives_.\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial derivatives deal with multi-variable functions by applying the usual rules we've just seen to a single variable in the function and effectively freezing the others (keeping them constant). We can follow this process for each of the variable in the function.\n",

        "<br><br>\n",
        "As above, the derivatives we seek will be partial ... i.e. we will find the derivative of $x_1$ independently of the other $x$'s. In our earlier discussion we were finding the ration between $\\Delta y$ and $\\Delta x$. Given this is a subset of the overall problem we use the lower case version of delta to show the partial ... so the notation would be $\\delta_{x_{1}}$ (double subscripts is a bit yucky in LaTex ... sorry). Let's look at the partial derivative of $X_{3}$:\n",

For completion, we can write out all three partial derivatives (but without discussion of the calculations - its the same as we've already seen):<br><br>\n",
